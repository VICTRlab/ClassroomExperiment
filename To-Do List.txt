5.4.0f3

Next steps:

-Implementing VR in Unity (Camera)
-Plan out both 2D and VR differences, for design and code
-Implement both 2D and VR in one application to simplify experiment process (on startup, have choice between the two)
-How to hook up transferring data from 3rd party hardware to Unity? (Heartrate data, skin conductor data, emotional experience data?)

Details:
-What do we ultimately want on the projector? To set up difference videos 

2D First product:
+2D game with face grafting all implemented smoothly. 
+Write procedure to upload content on the projector, facial grafting, importing characters, animation (and partly, code)
+Implement extra controllers such as video (forward, play, pause, etc.) and slideshow playing forward/backward (Can only do Play, Pause, Restart)
-Write procedure/document to edit certain variables such as delaytime for video
-Minor head/face animation for 2D version (breathing or something when looking into the mirror)
+Adding collision detection for the tables
+Be able to sit or stand on a chair
	-Make the transition gradual (lerp)
+We do want to keep generic character (m/f) as backup
+Remove the UI concepts (but keep the code) and Dicelab logo

Coordinate with Subuhi that lab is available after 5PM Tuesday.

Document:
-Randomize preset models for teacher
-Add more animations to these preset models
-Type how to remap buttons
-No animation for the participants (or maybe try a hacking way for idle, non-animation) Try to do this, make a speedy process?
-Recode movies to be an array
-Recode wikipedia page to be an array
-Edit the document a bit
